## Questions:

- What are the strongest predictors of price for airbnb listings in Amsterdam ?

- Type of Question: Predictive 

## Plan 

- We believe two following techniques can help us answer this question 
  1. Multiple linear regression
  2. Decision tree regression
  
  
 
## Summarization and Visualization 

 We will clean and filter the data and summarize the data as 5-number summary table. 
 We will make a map to visualize prices over different neighborhoods. 
 We will make multiple scatterplots to show different feature relationships with prices.
